    <para id="originalcaption">

<term>The original research paper states:</term>  <emphasis>"Pairwise comparisons between 437 COI sequences are separated into three categories: differences between individuals in the same species, differences between individuals in the same genus (not including intraspecific differences), and differences between individuals in the same family (not including intraspecific or intrageneric differences)."</emphasis>  
    </para>   

<para id="figure_explanation">
<term>What does the figure mean?</term>  Researchers used the <link url="http://www.genome.gov/10002096">DNA sequence</link> from the COI <link url="http://www.genome.gov/10002096">gene</link> in birds to figure out if the COI gene is useful as a DNA barcode-- in other words, a unique identifier for bird species.  
</para>
<para id="figexp2">
For the "Within Species" analysis (top panel), researchers compared one bird's 640-<link url="http://www.genome.gov/10002096">base pair</link> COI sequence with another sequence from a bird of the same species.  They recorded the number of differences between the two sequences (identical sequences would have zero differences, whereas completely different sequences would have 640 differences).  
</para>
<para id="figexp2a">
They repeated this for all of their bird sequences.  These comparisons are called "pairwise" because the data they recorded was based on each pair of sequences compared.  In the graph, the x-axis shows the number of differences between sequences, and the y-axis shows the percentage of comparisons.  
</para>

<para id="figexp3">
For the "Within Genus" analysis (middle panel), researchers compared one bird COI sequence with all the others of the same genus.  Again, they recorded the number of differences between the sequences, and then repeated this analysis for all the sequences.  Since members of the same genus might also be members of the same species, they didn't count those comparisons.  The same method was used for "Within Family" comparisons.</para>
